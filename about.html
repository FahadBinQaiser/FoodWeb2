          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p>
            Welcome to Pizza Place, where every slice tells a story! Founded in
            2004 by Ahmed Qayyum, a passionate pizza enthusiast, our restaurant
            has become a beloved spot in the city for those who crave authentic,
            mouthwatering pizza. Ahmed's journey began with a simple idea: to
            craft the perfect pizza using fresh ingredients, traditional
            techniques, and a love for the art of pizza-making.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Pizza Place, we believe in more than just making great pizzaâ€”we
            believe in creating an experience. With a cozy atmosphere and a menu
            filled with a variety of flavors, we strive to offer something
            special for everyone. As Ahmed often says, "A pizza is more than
            just a meal; it's a canvas of flavors that brings people together."
            Come join us at Pizza Place, where passion meets perfection in every
            bite!
